When Congress passes laws, federal agencies implement those laws through regulations. These regulations vary in subject, but include everything from ensuring water is safe to drink to setting health care standards. Regulations.gov is the place where users can find and comment on regulations. The APIs allow for users to find creative ways to present regulatory data. To learn more about the program visit the [About Us](http://www.regulations.gov/#!aboutProgram) page. 
##### Get started
We built the API to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into three major areas.

- [API Basics](basics/) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [Interactive API](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an interactive console.
- [Field References](fields/) lists and describes the type of information returned by the API.
